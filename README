# Exercises of *Learning Physics with Functional Programming*

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from the book [*Learn Physics with Functional Programming*](https://nostarch.com/learn-physics-functional-programming) by Scott N. Walck.

Each chapter of the book has a corresponding directory in this repo. I'm using [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/) to build and run the Haskell code.

> **Note:** This repository is not meant to be a solution guide.
If you spot any mistakes or questionable Haskell code, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/constraintAutomaton/learn-physic-with-functional-programming-exercises/issues).
